    fix: apply saved montage rate to streams on page load
    
    The montage view restores the Rate dropdown value from the
    zmMontageRate cookie on page load, but never sends the rate
    to the running streams. Streams always start at the camera's
    native capture rate regardless of the displayed dropdown value.
    The user must toggle the dropdown to a different value and back
    to actually apply the saved rate.
    
    Call monitorsSetRate() with the dropdown's current value at the
    end of startMonitors() so streams respect the persisted setting
    immediately.
